# 📈 Netflix Stock Price Prediction  
**End-to-End Data Science Project | Linear Regression + LSTM Neural Network**

## 🔍 Overview  
A professional stock price forecasting system that predicts NFLX closing prices using:  
- **Traditional ML**: Linear Regression (baseline)  
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras LSTM network  
- **Feature Engineering**: Daily returns, volatility metrics, and technical indicators  

Built during my **Data Science Internship @ Arch Technology** as part of Month 1 deliverables.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
`Python` `Pandas` `NumPy` `Scikit-learn` `TensorFlow` `Matplotlib` `Seaborn`  

## 📂 Key Features  
✅ **Data Pipeline**  
- Automated cleaning of real-world stock data (missing values, outliers)  
- Feature engineering for time-series analysis  

✅ **Modeling**  
- Dual-model approach for performance comparison  
- Hyperparameter-tuned LSTM with Early Stopping  

✅ **Visualization**  
- Interactive prediction vs actual price plots  
- Model performance metrics (MSE, MAE, R²)
